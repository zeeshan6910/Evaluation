# Data processing

In the `./pdfs` folder you will find a set of PDF files containing data that needs to be processed.
Your task is to extract the data from these PDFs and store it in a structured format for further analysis.

Assume that these won't be the only PDFs you'll need to process, and that you'll need to scale your solution to handle a larger number of files, both in 
terms of file structure and data volume.

Please code your solution using Python.

You're free to structure the project as you see fit, but make sure to include clear instructions on how to run your solution.

## Attention points

Make sure to consider the following points when designing your solution:
* code quality - make sure your code is clean, readable, and maintainable
* performance - as said before, in the future you'll need to process a larger number of files, so make sure your solution is scalable
* error handling - make sure your solution can handle exceptions and edge cases (malformed files, etc.)
* testing - make sure your solution is well tested
* git usage - make sure your commits are well organized and that you have a good commit history
